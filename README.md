# WordRepresentableGraphs
Algorithms for word-representations of graphs. This is all very related to my talk at the Workshop on Words and Complexity. 

**graphcheck2**.py - An implementation of the Fenwick-tree algorithm - input a 2-uniform word and a graph, and it will tell you whether the word is a word-representation of the graph.

**randomword**.py - find the number of edges in a random 2-uniform word.  
**vals**.txt - the 2-uniform words representing the cycle graphs for number of vertices = 3, 4, 5, and 6.
