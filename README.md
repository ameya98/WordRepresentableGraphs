# WordRepresentableGraphs
Algorithms for word-representations of graphs. This is all very related to my talk at the Workshop on Words and Complexity. 

**graphcheck2**.py - An implementation of the Fenwick-tree algorithm  
Input a 2-uniform word and a graph, and this outputs whether the word is a word-representation of the graph.
Includes a complete Fenwick Tree implementation out-of-the-box.

**randomword**.py  
Finds the number of edges in the alternating subgraph of a random 2-uniform word.  

**vals**.txt  
The 2-uniform words representing the cycle graphs for number of vertices = 3, 4, 5, and 6.
